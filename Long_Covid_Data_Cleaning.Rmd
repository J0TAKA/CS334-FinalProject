## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
file <- "LLCP2022.XPT"
raw <- read_xpt(file,col_select = NULL,skip = 0,n_max = Inf,.name_repair = "unique")
raw
varOfInt <- raw %>% select("_STATE","SEQNO","SEXVAR","GENHLTH","PHYSHLTH","MENTHLTH","POORHLTH","MEDCOST1","CHECKUP1","EXERANY2","SLEPTIM1","LASTDEN4","CVDINFR4","CVDCRHD4","CVDSTRK3","ASTHMA3","CHCSCNC1","CHCOCNC1","CHCCOPD3","ADDEPEV3","CHCKDNY2","HAVARTH4","DIABETE4","EDUCA","INCOME3","PREGNANT","WTKG3","HTM4","SMOKDAY2","USENOW3","ECIGNOW2","LCSFIRST","LCSLAST","LCSNUMCG","ALCDAY4","AVEDRNK3","DRNK3GE5","FLUSHOT7","PNEUVAC4","COVIDPOS","COVIDSMP","COVIDPRM","PDIABTS1","PREDIAB2","HPVADVC4","HPVADSHT","SHINGLE2","COVIDVA1","COVIDNU1","FOODSTMP","SDHFOOD1","SDHBILLS","SDHTRNSP","MARIJAN1","MARJSMOK","MARJEAT","MARJVAPE","MARJDAB","MARJOTHR","LASTSMK2","MENTCIGS","MENTECIG","RRCLASS3","_URBSTAT","MSCODE","_RFHLTH","_PHYS14D","_MENT14D","_HLTHPLN","_TOTINDA","_MICHD","_LTASTH1","_RACE1","_SEX","_AGEG5YR","_BMI5CAT","_EDUCAG","_INCOMG1","_SMOKER3","_CURECI2","_RFDRHV8","DIFFWALK","_BMI5")
```
```{r}
longCovidRep<- varOfInt %>% select("SEQNO","_STATE","_RACE1","_SEX","_AGEG5YR","_EDUCAG","_INCOMG1","_SMOKER3","_CURECI2","_RFDRHV8","GENHLTH","PHYSHLTH","MENTHLTH","POORHLTH","MEDCOST1","EXERANY2","SLEPTIM1","CVDINFR4","CVDCRHD4","CVDSTRK3","ASTHMA3","CHCOCNC1","CHCCOPD3","ADDEPEV3","CHCKDNY2","DIABETE4","PREGNANT","WTKG3","HTM4","COVIDPOS","COVIDSMP","COVIDPRM","PREDIAB2","COVIDVA1","FOODSTMP","_URBSTAT","_BMI5")
```


```{r}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
cleaned <- filter(longCovidRep, !is.na(COVIDSMP), COVIDSMP != 7,  COVIDSMP != 9 )
trun_set <- select(cleaned,-WTKG3,-POORHLTH,-HTM4,-COVIDPRM,-PREDIAB2,-PREGNANT,-COVIDPOS,-FOODSTMP,-COVIDVA1,
-SEQNO,-"_STATE")
trun_set

```

```{r}
apply(X = is.na(trun_set), MARGIN = 2, FUN = sum)

```
```{r}
cleaned_trun <- trun_set
names(cleaned_trun)<- c("Race","Sex","Age","Education","Income","Smoker","ECig","Drinker","GeneralHealth","PhysHealth","MentalHealth","HealthAccess","ExerciseLevel","Sleep","HeartAttack","HeartDisease","Stroke","Asthma","Cancer","COPD","Depression","KidneyDisease","Diabetes","LongCovid","Urban","BMI")

  mutate(Diabetes= case_match(Diabetes, 1 ~ 1,2 ~ 1, 3 ~ 0, 4 ~ 0 ,.default = PhysHealth))

#Pregnant
#cleaned_trun <- cleaned_trun %>%
#  mutate(Pregnant= case_match(Pregnant, NA ~ 0,1 ~ 1, 2 ~ 0, .default = Pregnant)) %>% filter(Pregnant != 9, Pregnant != 7)

#COVID

 #cleaned_trun <- cleaned_trun %>% filter(!is.na(BMI))

```

```{r}
